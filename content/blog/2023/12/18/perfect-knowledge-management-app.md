I still haven't found the perfect knowledge management app. [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) outline doesn't quite click with me. I end up creating a log of useless blocks that I never revisit and link from other blocks. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)'s longer text format is better. It makes me think thoroughly about what I'm writing and give it a structure. However, it misses some things that I consider essential:

* **An app that's native to Apple platforms.** Not native in the sense that it compiles to native. But native in the sense that it embraces the platform patterns and capabilities and doesn't try to fit web patterns into the platform. - **Auto-linking** of notes. We've seen a spread of technologies like [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) that can be used to calculate semantic similarity between texts. Imagine using that for suggesting links between notes. - **Inbox** for ideas to process. Sometimes I'm running and I've got an idea that I'd like to jot down and process later into a longer note. I'd like to just press a button, record the idea, and have it transcribed into text. Or share content that I find on the web with the app for later processing. - **A standard structure** that's documented to allow users to port their notes and foster an ecosystem of apps.

The itch is becoming too itchy so I don't know if I'll be able to resist the temptation of building it myself as a hobby. Once we ship Tuist 4 and Tuist Cloud and have the business running of course.
