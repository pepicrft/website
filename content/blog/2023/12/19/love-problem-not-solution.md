Has it happened to you that you get too attached to a solution to a problem instead of the problem itself? This is something that didn't happen to me earlier in my career, but as I advanced and learned more about other technologies and approaches, which I became excited about, it started to happen more often. This is not the case with [Tuist](https://tuist.io/) where the technology required to solve the problem is set, [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). But as I poured some spare thinking into the right tech for [Glossia](https://github.com/glossia/glossia), I became more indecisive about the right tech to use.

To illustrate this, let me share my most recent experience. When I navigate the web, a pattern that I notice is that many websites that are designed with JavaScript frameworks are well designed. Today, in particular, I was amazed by how well-designed the websites made by the folks behind [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) are: [Elk](https://elk.zone), [NuxtUI](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started), [Volta](https://volta.net), [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). *Guess my thinking after seeing those websites?* Is there a cause-effect relationship between the technology and the design? Or did developers with good taste happen to meet in those communities? Will technology like [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) have a strong connection with a gorgeous design and a first-class experience in [Glossia](https://glossia.ai)? Should I reconsider the decision to use [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) now that it's early in the lifetime of the project?

These are the questions that I mentally navigate when I'm exposed to new technologies. And it's draining. I have to make an effort to look at things with enough perspective to realize that:

* Technology is an implementation detail. You can achieve a great design with any. - Distractions for the technology are a way to procrastinate on the problem. - The problem is the most important thing. The solution is just a means to an end. - Other factors are equally important when choosing a technology, not just the design.

I want to change my mindset to stop doing this because it's fatiguing. When I look around and see people that I admire, I see that they are focused on the problem and not the solution. They pick a technology that clicks with them and they stick with it. One of them is [@dhh](https://x.com/dhh). He loves Ruby, and he is taking Ruby everywhere. [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio) does the same with PHP. There are many examples in the Swift community too, like [John Sundell](https://mastodon.social/@johnsundell).

Note that I don't want to isolate myself from other technologies. I learn a lot from them which I can use to cross-pollinate my thinking. However, I need to do it enough so that I can learn from them and not get distracted by them. This is where the challenge lies.

Have you experienced something similar?
