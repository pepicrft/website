Just over a month has elapsed since [I embarked on my **entrepreneurial journey**](__GHOST_URL__/blog/2023/05/28/indie-developer). I thought it would be an enriching experience to share my current standing, the emotional journey, and my forward-looking plans.

Firstly, I revel in the ability to bring my ideas to life without the need for consensus from multiple stakeholders or trying to convince senior leadership about its merits. It feels like a breath of fresh air to not have to deal with those challenges anymore, though it doesn't come without its own set of trade-offs. **The challenge is not to solely chase joy and fulfillment but also to create a profitable, sustainable business.**

The primary engine for this is [Tuist](https://tuist.io) and **Tuist Cloud**. Tuist Cloud, a feature set necessitating an HTTP server, forms the ideal foundation to create a sustainable business model. This is vital to ensure the longevity of [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist), currently buckling under the weight of an influx of support and feature requests. As for whether it will be open source, the jury's still out. Initially, **I aim to establish the most suitable form for the business**, after which it will be prudent to navigate the legalities associated with making it open source. In terms of the programming language and frameworks, I have chosen [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) for their ability to streamline my processes and accelerate iterations. While Swift on the Server shows promise, it's currently more time-efficient to leverage existing solutions than to build missing components.

Alongside this, I have conceived a tool designed for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) developers, using Tuist as a foundation. However, that idea is on hold until the feasibility of Tuist Cloud is confirmed. If Tuist Cloud doesn't meet expectations, this alternate path awaits exploration.

A secondary focus of mine is [**Glossia**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/glossiaai), an AI-based localization tool I'm co-creating with my wife, a former member of the localization team at [Shopify](https://shopify.com). We recognized several issues in the localization process that need addressing:

* Localization often ends up as an after-thought despite its potential to make products more accessible. \* Large localization entities struggle with scaling their efforts and sometimes resort to using Google Translate-based products. \* The inherent complexity and obfuscation within localization can be daunting.

The solution to these issues appeared elusive **until we delved deeper into the possibilities of AI**. Our subsequent experiments hint at a potential breakthrough. Our combined expertise allows us to envision a solution that's easy to use and integrate into existing workflows. We're vigorously working towards an MVP before summer ends. Provided things go smoothly, we'll cultivate a community of translators and developers and strive for integration with the most popular frameworks, including [Shopify Apps](https://apps.shopify.com). We firmly believe in the necessity of translating these apps to ensure accessibility.

In conclusion, **I am thoroughly enjoying this journey despite the financial uncertainty that looms**. I remain hopeful that we will soon see clarity on that front. If by year-end the financial landscape remains murky, we might seek external support, equipped with a solid foundation of work. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and I am eager to share more about our journey in future posts.
