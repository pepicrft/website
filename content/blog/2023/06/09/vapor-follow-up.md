It turns out that [telling the Fly CLI to build with a local Docker](__GHOST_URL__/blog/2023/06/08/vapor-memory) is insufficient. When run in an M1 or M2 architecture, Docker uses [QEMU](https://twitter.com/FranzJBusch/status/1667109741452054529?s=20) to cross-compile the binary, and that causes the issues that I was seeing. To fix it, I could have configured Docker to use [Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)), but instead, I decided to run the deployment from a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/tuist/cloud/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml). Due to the GitHub Actions environment's architecture, issues don't arise, and I was able to deploy the app successfully.
