I've recently delved into the world of mocking in Elixir and have been particularly intrigued by the Mox package, endorsed by José Valim. While studying this approach, I noticed that it could introduce a considerable amount of boilerplate code into a codebase, along with potential inconsistencies in how module references are managed in the application environment. I couldn't help but think there had to be a more streamlined solution.

Take, for example, the typical module structure in such a setup:

```
defmodule MyModule do
 @behaviour __MODULE__.Behaviour

 def hello(name) do
 application_env_module().hello(name)
 end

 def application_env_module() do
 get_in(Application.get_env(:my_app, :modules), [:my_module]) || __MODULE__.Implementation
 end

 defmodule Implementation do
 @behaviour MyModule.Behaviour

 def hello(name) do
 "Hello #{name}"
 end
 end

 defmodule Behaviour do
 @callback hello(name :: String.t()) :: any()
 end
end
```

In this example, `MyModule` serves as a facade that selects an appropriate module based on the application environment configuration. If a module atom is specified, it's utilized; otherwise, the code defaults to the built-in implementation. However, this structure has some downsides:

* Boilerplate code that acts as a proxy to the underlying implementation could be automatically generated. - The method `application_env_module` and related naming conventions can become inconsistent across the codebase.

To tackle these challenges and experiment with Elixir macros, I created a new package for the Elixir ecosystem named [`modulex`](https://hex.pm/packages/modulex). With this package, the previous example can be refactored as follows:

```
defmodule MyModule do
 use Application.Module

 defimplementation do
 def hello(name) do
 "Hello #{name}"
 end
 end

 defbehaviour do
 @callback hello(name :: String.t()) :: any()
 end
end
```

Notice how much more concise and ergonomic the code has become. I chose to prioritize convention over configuration, thereby standardizing the naming of child modules and the keys within the application environment.

For those who use [Mox](https://github.com/dashbitco/mox) or [Hammox](https://github.com/msz/hammox) for mock definitions, you can easily set a mock like so:

```
# test_helper.exs

Mox.defmock(MyApplication.Module.mock_module(), for: MyApplication.Module.behaviour_module())
MyApplication.Module.put_application_env_module(MyApplication.Module.mock_module())
```

I'd love to hear any feedback on the implementation or the API design. This is my inaugural venture into Elixir macros, and the journey has been both rewarding and a process of trial and error.
