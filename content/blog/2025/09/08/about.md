I'm a Berlin-based builder. For the past ten years, I have been a hands-on and adaptable problem solver, collaborating with start-ups and [e-commerce platforms](https://shopify.com/) and building open-source solutions like [Tuist](https://tuist.io/). I'm currently working with [Marek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marek-f-71853b89/) on turning Tuist into a sustainable business.

My work is trusted by [Shopify](https://shopify.com/), [American Express](https://americanexpress.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [Bloomberg](https://shopify.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), [Monday](https://monday.com/), [Just Eat](https://justeat.com/), [Etsy](https://etsy.com/), and [Adidas](https://adidas.com/).
