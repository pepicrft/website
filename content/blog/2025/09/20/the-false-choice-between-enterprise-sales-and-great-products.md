Have you ever avoided using a product because its enterprise-first, sales-driven approach compromised every aspect of the user experience? This has happened to me countless times, and I always wondered if striking a balance would be difficult. But the more we invest in shaping [Tuist](https://tuist.dev), the more I realize that **marketing and selling to large enterprises doesn't have to conflict** with creating a great product—despite what many B2B companies seem to believe.

Since most B2B revenue comes from large enterprises, it makes business sense to focus on them. And it's true that some enterprises might not prioritize elegant product design as long as their immediate problems are solved. But if you ignore thoughtful product shaping, you'll end up with a convoluted mess—a heterogeneous collection of tools that lack any cohesive narrative or intuitive user journey.

It's similar to ["vibe coding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) in a way. You can vibe-code an entire SaaS product, but you must ensure that each piece integrates seamlessly into the whole. Otherwise, you'll find yourself constantly hacking new features onto existing layers instead of building a coherent system. Many developer tools fall into this trap, but at Tuist, we refuse to accept it.

We believe every component should harmonize with the broader ecosystem, playing a role that evolves alongside our vision. A CLI that generates projects transforms into an interface for an integrated developer dashboard. QA teams use previews to test their colleagues' work. A single line of code in an Xcode project seamlessly connects your environment with Tuist. Product shaping is continuous work that enterprise customers actually appreciate because it makes the product a joy to use—and who doesn't want joy? There's a reason we prefer Apple products over alternatives, or why we choose Mise for environment management instead of juggling multiple disconnected tools.

A great product doesn't need to be littered with "Contact Sales" buttons or limited to restrictive demos with fake data that fail to demonstrate real value. Design shouldn't be an afterthought or heavily influenced by sales strategy. **Exceptional product craft and successful enterprise sales are completely compatible**—it's just that some founders treat the product as merely a means to profit. We see product excellence and business success as two elements that must dance in harmony to deliver the best value to all our users (enterprises included) while capturing fair value in return.
