I’ve been reflecting on Tuist’s journey and where we’re headed. Despite all the changes we’ve made to the product over the years, one thing has remained constant: our focus on large-scale organizations. That’s our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)—the people we sell to.

The reality of the mobile developer tools market is sobering. It’s not tiny, but it’s not huge either, especially compared to the broader tech industry. Mobile teams at large companies rarely exceed 40 developers, which caps account sizes. Developer productivity—our core value proposition—isn’t easily measurable unless you wrap it in AI and sell the FOMO of missing the next productivity revolution.

Even when organizations see the value and are willing to pay, you’re looking at seat-based pricing in a constrained market. I believe this explains why we don’t see many companies thriving purely in mobile tooling. The mobile developer tools market specifically has structural limitations that make growth challenging. Investors also have less appetite for this space, partly because it’s hugely controlled by Apple and Google, who strongly influence the development lifecycle and app distribution.

Here’s the thing though: I want Tuist to grow, and I see this as an exciting challenge rather than a limitation.

**The key insight is that we don’t need to stay confined to traditional developer productivity.** Tuist has always been a generic name, which gives us flexibility. More importantly, we have incredible foundations: years of open source work, a strong community, and robust infrastructure investments. I see Tuist evolving into open infrastructure for mobile developers—something you can self-host for free if you want, licensed fairly, built transparently.

This model has worked brilliantly for many source-available products. Instead of competing on price, we compete on being better and more open. Large enterprises will pay significant money for infrastructure they depend on, especially when it scales with usage rather than just seat count.

The most successful approaches in adjacent spaces involve becoming critical infrastructure that grows alongside customer success. Companies that position themselves in revenue-critical paths, while also building strong developer communities that turn into enterprise advocates, create powerful flywheels.

What excites me is how we can leverage the infrastructure we’ve already built. We’re running ClickHouse databases and soon Grafana dashboards—infrastructure that helps users and organizations understand how users interact with their apps at every stage. Our API keeps expanding, with account tokens and scopes coming soon. The throughline is becoming clear: we’ll build a Tuist SDK that connects app runtimes to our open infrastructure, giving developers unprecedented visibility into their applications.

Eventually, we’ll expand to Android since our solutions are fundamentally cross-platform.

The best infrastructure feels invisible when it works and indispensable when you need it. That’s what I want to build with Tuist—not just better tools, but essential open foundations that mobile developers like us can trust, extend, and build upon. I’m excited to share more about this journey as we continue creating what I believe will become critical open infrastructure for mobile development.
