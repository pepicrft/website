I’ve noticed that my interactions and publications on social networks these days tend to be pessimistic, accompanied by anger, frustration, and competitiveness. Overall, they seem to trigger primitive behaviors in me that don’t feel natural when I’m outside that context. Unfortunately, this behavior has started to leak into the offline world.

It wasn’t always like this. I used to be quite positive and enthusiastic—a friend to friends, supportive in my interactions, and always leaning toward collaboration and doing things together. I don’t think that part of me is gone; it’s just overshadowed by these other behaviors and more primitive feelings.

It’s hard to pinpoint where this shift began. I believe social networks’ optimization for extracting these behaviors from people might have played a role. My previous working environment, which was filled with certain toxic patterns, also influenced me because I didn’t know how to set boundaries at the time. Then, of course, there was the pandemic, which isolated all of us, and let’s not forget the many winters in Berlin—those probably didn’t help either.

But here’s the thing: I believe this is something I can change, and I’ll start by leaning into positivity and constructivism. Sure, the world isn’t perfect, and there are things we’d rather not think about, but if we all collaborate more and push back against the individualism that’s been ingrained in us, I think beautiful things can happen. I want to be a catalyst for that change.

Bear with me—it’ll take time—but I really want to do this because it’ll improve my overall well-being. Being a grumpy person on the Internet hurts me deeply in my personal life, and I don’t want that anymore.
