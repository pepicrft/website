Developers have always been able to build. If you need something, you build it. That was our superpower. No one gives you the tools, you create them.

Except now coding agents make that superpower accessible to everyone. You describe what you want, and it happens. No syntax errors, no Stack Overflow, no late nights debugging. This is wonderful. This is also dangerous.

## What we are really selling

Founders talk about this all the time. When you sell software to a company, you are not selling code. You are selling liability. You are selling someone to make sure the servers stay up. You are selling someone to fix the bug that will inevitably appear at 3am. You are selling someone to add the feature that the customer asked for six months ago.

Writing code became cheaper. The rest did not.

## The ego problem

The real problem is our ego. The processes we spent years mastering. The conventions we defend like religion. How important is it that a method is called in a particular way? How important are tabs versus spaces? How important is the code review ritual where we argue about things that a test would catch in seconds?

Agents are not just challenging these things. They are revealing that they were always superfluous. We built elaborate systems to catch mistakes that we should have never made in the first place. We designed processes to compensate for human error when we should have designed systems that make human error impossible.

## Letting go

Peter Steinberger from OpenFlow wrote that he stopped reviewing code. That felt radical. Now it feels inevitable.

The more we trust agents, the fewer humans we need. The fewer humans, the simpler the organization. No one needs a permission matrix when an agent can plug into every system. No one needs a dashboard to understand headers when the agent can read them for you.

We need to be weakly opinionated about how we used to do things. We need to be strongly curious about what the new capabilities enable.

Resisting change because that is how things have always been is detrimental to the entire industry.

The future belongs to people who are willing to let go.
