Developers have always been able to build. If you need something, you build it. That was our superpower. No one gives you the tools, you create them.

Except now coding agents make that superpower accessible to everyone. You describe what you want, and it happens. No syntax errors, no Stack Overflow, no late nights debugging. This is wonderful. This is also dangerous.

## What we are really selling

Founders talk about this all the time. When you sell software to a company, you are not selling code. You are selling liability — someone to answer when things break at 3am. You are selling reliability, performance, the knowledge that someone understands your system deeply enough to fix what breaks and improve what works.

Writing code became cheaper. The rest did not.

## The ego problem

The real problem is our ego. The processes we spent years mastering. The conventions we defend like religion. How important is it that a method is called in a particular way? How important are tabs versus spaces? How important is the code review ritual where we argue about things that a test would catch in seconds?

Agents are not just challenging these things. They are revealing that they were always superfluous. We built elaborate systems to catch mistakes that we should have never made in the first place. We designed processes to compensate for human error when we should have designed systems that make human error impossible.

## Letting go

Peter Steinberger from OpenFlow wrote that he stopped reviewing code. That felt radical. Now it feels inevitable.

The more we trust agents, the fewer humans we need. The fewer humans, the simpler the organization. No one needs a permission matrix when an agent can plug into every system. No one needs a dashboard to understand headers when the agent can read them for you.

The challenge is not just about tools — it is about mental models. The ideas we have accumulated over years of practice. The patterns we recognize, the architectures we defend, the "right way" to do things that we have internalized. None of it is wrong. All of it might be obsolete.

We need to let go — of the certainty that we know the best way, of the identity that comes from mastering a process, of the comfort in knowing how things work. Then we need to come back, curious, open, ready to build again with new foundations.

Resisting change because that is how things have always been is detrimental to the entire industry.

The future belongs to people who are willing to let go.
