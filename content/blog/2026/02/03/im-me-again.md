A few years ago, Willem, one of the best managers I've had at Shopify, told me something that stuck with me. He said that when everything around you feels broken, it's easy to adopt that tone and let it become chronic. I've been thinking about that lately.

I'm a person who makes things happen. Push things forward. Get shit done. It might feel autistic at times. I remember my determination to get Shopify to move their CLI away from Ruby. Or my incessant push for ideas, some reached a destination, others faded, but I never started with "this won't work."

Then some events in the past years had a very negative impact on that attitude. They flooded me with insecurities and a very pessimistic view on everything around me, including AI.

The sudden stop from Shopify's frenzy environment. A running accident that left me abandoned by the system of the country I lived in. I decided to build the company in between, and that permeated into me.

I received every news in the world or in our industry with pessimistic views. Oh? That sucks? This idea? Might not work. AI? Such a bullshit idea, I like coding. I didn't like what I was doing.

But something has happened, and the spark is igniting back in me. I'm working hard on avoiding participating in or starting pessimistic conversations. I'm tinkering like the early days in Tuist, and having a lot of fun.

Just today, and thanks to the multitasking that coding agents enable, I solved a problem that has sucked for many, many months for us. Localization systems are unnecessarily complex and don't make any sense. I'm me again.

And sure, this has nothing to do with Tuist, but this is the kind of impact we want to leave in the world, not just through the main endeavors, but through secondary craft that advances our industry.

People get surprised that things are released so prolifically, or even that we make them open source without charging for it. My primary source of joy is building, and we built a company so we can do that full time and capture a portion of the value that I provide.

I'm me again. AI has given me the optimism and the joy for building, part of which I had lost. I no longer feel that attached to Swift, and I'm starting to fall more and more in love with developers being productive.

I was chatting with someone the other day about how rare it is to find people that fall in love with problems. I think I'm one of those, and I'll protect that no matter what, because that's my happiness.
