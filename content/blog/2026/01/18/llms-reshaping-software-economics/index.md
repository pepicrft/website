I've been thinking a lot about economics lately. Not macroeconomics per se, but the economics of software. More specifically, the economics that the software industry has built on top of, the artificial limits, the churn, the upgrades, the subscriptions. The things that keep you paying and keep you engaged.

LLMs have the power to workaround all of that. I can't stop thinking about it.

## The TODO SaaS Example

Let's take TODO lists as an example. There are hundreds of TODO applications, most of them subscription-based, most of them with a freemium model. They store your data in their cloud, they sync across devices, they have collaboration features.

But what if I told you that a TODO SaaS could just be a bunch of markdown files in an environment you control? Nothing more than that. You edit the files, you organize them, you sync them with git. The TODO functionality is just a view on top of those files.

That's not a new idea. But LLMs make it possible to build that view with minimal effort. The intelligence layer that once required a team of engineers can now be assembled in hours.

Tobi Lütke built a tool to visualize an MRI scan using Claude. That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. The gap between having an idea and having a working prototype is collapsing. When that happens, the value proposition of a TODO SaaS that charges you fifteen dollars a month starts to look ridiculous.

## The Churn Economy

Software companies have built their economics on churn. They need you to keep paying, so they create artificial reasons for you to upgrade. New features that require new subscriptions. Integrations that break unless you update. Security updates that only work on the latest version.

This isn't malicious, but it is a business model. The question LLMs force us to ask is: how much of this is actually necessary?

If I can build a TODO application in an afternoon with LLMs, and if that TODO application does everything I need, why would I pay fifteen dollars a month? Why would I sign up for a subscription that automatically renews?

The answer used to be "because you don't have the technical skills." LLMs are dissolving that answer.

## The Liability Question

I can already hear the objection. Sure, but software is more than just the software itself. You don't know what you're talking about. Companies want vendors that can be liable if something goes wrong. Companies that ensure the infrastructure runs smoothly. That have SLAs. That have support teams.

And to some extent, that's valid. When you're running mission-critical infrastructure, you want someone to call when it breaks.

But here's what I think people miss: a lot of that infrastructure is becoming commoditized. Kubernetes runs everywhere. Postgres runs everywhere. Redis runs everywhere. The primitives are open source, well-documented, and reliable. What companies are really paying for is the wrapper, the SLA, the liability insurance.

That wrapper is getting thinner by the day.

## What Might Companies Be Worth?

This is the uncomfortable question. If the underlying infrastructure is commoditized, and if LLMs can build the wrappers, and if everything can be assembled from open source components, what is a software company actually worth?

I'm not saying software companies are worthless. I'm saying the economics are shifting. The moats are disappearing. The defensibility is eroding.

When you can spin up a TODO application in an afternoon, when you can build an MRI viewer in a weekend, when you can assemble integrations with minimal effort, the value of a company that sells those integrations starts to look different.

Many companies have raised endless rounds of venture capital on the promise of network effects and defensibility. But when the cost of building something approaches zero, and when the thing you build is just an assembly of open source components, what exactly is defensible?

This isn't a critique of the industry. It's an observation of where things are heading.

## Why I'm Building Micelio

When I'm coding Micelio, I can't avoid thinking about the relationship I want to have with it. Part of me wants it to be this tiny yet powerful new approach to building software that challenges not only software, but the tech industry itself.

I want to prove that you don't need endless capital to build something that has long-lasting impact on people. Many companies want you to think otherwise. They want you to believe that building something meaningful requires a team of hundreds and millions in funding.

I don't think that's true. And as Micelio takes shape, we're going to need some structure. We'll need some resources to coordinate work full time. But most of the work will be delegated to agentic workflows.

Some companies will never embrace that. I am. And it's working out. And it's quite fascinating to see.

## A Personal Note

I'm in a privileged position. I'm the CEO of Tuist, which means this can be my guinea pig. I don't have to think about money. I have a job that I like, and an appetite for trying new things outside of work. It's just me.

I like tinkering with things. I like tinkering with new versions of how things can be. And Micelio is a lot of fun.

This is not Tuist. It's not a new company. It's not a pivot. It's not me signaling that I'm looking for something else. Micelio is what I do in my free time because I like building things, and because I believe the future of software development looks very different from its present.

If anyone from Tuist is reading this: don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. This is exploration, not abandonment. It's curiosity, not restlessness. It's me being me.

## What's Next

If you're curious about what I'm building, you can find Micelio at [micelio.dev](https://micelio.dev). No pressure to use it, no sales pitch, just an experiment in progress.

The future of software economics is still being written. I'm just trying to contribute a paragraph or two.
