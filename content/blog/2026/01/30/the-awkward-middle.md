Every technology lives in an awkward middle. The pioneers have moved on to newer problems, the late majority has not yet arrived, and the few of us left in the middle carry the weight of making something work that is not quite ready for the world. This is the adolescence of technology, that strange and uncertain phase where the promise is visible but the path forward remains foggy.

Dario Amodei wrote about this phenomenon with clarity that stays with me. Technologies do not emerge fully formed and immediately useful. They arrive as curiosities, as experiments, as proofs of concept that demonstrate possibility but lack the robustness, the elegance, the reliability that would make them the obvious choice for anyone with options. The adolescence is where the work happens, where the rough edges get smoothed not by the original inventors but by the stubborn few who see something worth nurturing.

I have been thinking about this lately because I see the same pattern unfolding in the infrastructure that surrounds software development. The tools we use today, the platforms that host collaboration, the systems that track change and enable coordination among developers, all of these emerged from a different era. They were designed for human beings sitting at keyboards, writing code in the quiet of their offices, collaborating with colleagues they could walk over and talk to. The assumptions baked into these systems reflect a world where a handful of developers worked on a codebase, where change was measured in commits and the occasional branch, where the pace of iteration allowed for careful thought and deliberate action.

That world has not disappeared but it has become a subset of a larger reality. Today, software development increasingly involves automated agents, AI systems that write code, review changes, suggest improvements, and participate in the creative process alongside human beings. The scale of activity has shifted dramatically. A single project might see thousands of changes per day, not from a handful of developers but from dozens or hundreds of autonomous agents working in parallel on different aspects of the same codebase. The traditional tools were not built for this. They strain under the weight of activity they were never designed to handle. They lose context that matters. They optimize for workflows that no longer represent the dominant use case.

This is where I find myself drawn to the question of what comes next. What would a version control system look like if it were designed from the ground up for a world where AI agents are first-class participants in software development? Not an afterthought, not a bolt-on feature, but the primary user experience around which everything else is organized. I have been exploring this question in my own work and the answers that emerge challenge many of the assumptions I did not even know I was carrying.

The first and most fundamental shift concerns what we are actually tracking when we track change. The systems I grew up with, the tools that shaped my understanding of software development, they track what happened. A commit captures a snapshot of files at a moment in time. The history is a sequence of these snapshots, frozen moments that can be inspected and compared. But the snapshot does not contain the conversation that led to the change, the reasoning that guided the decisions, the alternatives that were considered and rejected. All of that context lives elsewhere, if it lives at all, scattered across issue trackers and chat logs and the fading memories of the people involved.

What if the unit of change were not a snapshot but a session, a container that holds not just the diff but the intent, the dialogue, the thinking that produced the change? A session would capture what the author was trying to accomplish, the questions they asked and the answers they received, the tradeoffs they considered and why they chose one path over another. This is not mere metadata to be stored alongside the real data of commits and files. This is the real data, the part that makes the change comprehensible to anyone who comes across it months or years later. The diff is the artifact of the session, not the other way around.

Building such a system requires rethinking where the source of truth lives. The traditional model places the repository on the developer's machine, with a central server acting as a coordinator and backup. This made sense when the network was unreliable and developers spent significant time offline, working against a local copy of the code. But in a world where automated agents are constantly running, where the volume of activity exceeds what any individual could review, the local-first model becomes a liability. The interesting work happens at the scale of the entire project, not the scale of individual machines. A system designed for this reality would place the authoritative state in durable, shared storage from which any client could derive its view. The cloud is not a convenience but a requirement.

The implications cascade through every layer of the system. If the source of truth lives in shared storage, then conflict resolution changes fundamentally. There is no need for complex merge algorithms that try to reconcile divergent histories because the shared storage knows the current state and can validate proposed changes against it. If every change is a session that captures intent and reasoning, then review becomes a conversation about goals and decisions rather than a line-by-line inspection of diffs. If the system is designed for automated agents as primary users, then the interfaces and protocols can optimize for programmatic access rather than human-friendliness, with human readability as a derived quality rather than a primary concern.

None of this is ready for production. Every piece of it is still finding its form. The sessions need better schemas. The storage needs benchmarking and tuning. The protocols need to be documented and stabilized. The user experience, such as it is, needs to be refined until it becomes invisible rather than an obstacle. This is the awkward middle, the adolescence of this technology. The promise is there, the direction is clear, but the work of making it robust and elegant and reliable remains.

What keeps me engaged with this work is the sense that the alternative is untenable. The current dominant platform was designed for a different era and it shows. Teams struggle with scale that exceeds what the tools were built to handle. Context is lost because the systems do not preserve it. The conversation about changes happens outside the version control system, disconnected from the changes themselves, impossible to find when someone needs to understand why something was done a certain way. The adolescence is uncomfortable but it is also necessary. We cannot skip this phase. We can only work through it, with the faith that the technologies we are nurturing will eventually mature into the reliable foundations that the next generation of developers will take for granted.

I do not know how long this adolescence will last. It might be years before the approaches I am exploring become viable for anyone outside the early adopter set. The dominant platform is not standing still, and it would be foolish to assume that incumbents cannot evolve. But I am convinced that the problems we face today require different solutions than the ones we inherited, and that the work of building those solutions, however awkward and uncertain, is worth doing. The awkward middle is where things get made. The pioneers have their moment of inspiration, the late majority their moment of adoption, but in between, in the uncertain middle, the actual work of making things work happens. I am grateful to be there, even when it is uncomfortable.
