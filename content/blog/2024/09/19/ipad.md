As a kid, I used to paint a lot—mostly with oils. It was the one activity that could keep me still. Unfortunately, over time, I let it slip away, replaced by more logical pursuits like programming and my studies, which took over the space that creative work once held.

In an effort to balance building a company and coding with activities unrelated to work, I’ve recently returned to painting—this time, using an iPad. I was genuinely surprised by the power of these devices, which I had previously used only for reading. It once seemed almost pointless to own one, but now I understand why creatives gravitate toward it, and why Apple markets it to them. It’s a remarkably powerful and portable tool for creative expression.

I’m even considering exploring video editing with it, using some short clips I recorded in Berlin—just to see how far I can stretch my creativity. It feels like there’s a part of my brain that’s been dormant, waiting to be reawakened. There’s also something truly beautiful about engaging in these activities without any expectation of outcome, unlike coding, which has become more outcome-driven now that there’s a company to build. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that my mind thrives when it has room to roam. To code for the joy of coding, to paint for the joy of painting, to walk for the joy of walking...

Anyway, I’m on a flight to Madrid to attend NSSpain, and I thought I’d share some thoughts on iPads after spending some time drawing on mine.
