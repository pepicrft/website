The other day, while watching [a talk by DHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw), he mentioned a term that stuck with me: monkey brains. He used it to describe our brain’s limited capacity to hold multiple things at once and emphasized the importance of **conceptually compressing complexities to reduce the mental load.**

Why bring this up? Because I think I’m stretching my brain to hold too many programming languages and paradigms. Over the past year, I’ve gone from being highly proficient in Swift to learning and familiarizing myself with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (in the context of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)), and most recently, [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). I’ve also explored [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and, more recently, [Zig](https://ziglang.org). There’s something valuable about staying informed—you gain new ideas and consolidate concepts across languages. For instance, many concepts in Swift are rooted in Rust, and learning Rust helps deepen your understanding of Swift. But this juggling act is becoming overwhelming for my "monkey brain."

What makes it especially draining is that much of my mental energy is now focused on understanding the complexities of building a company. I’m asking my brain to absorb information like it did 10 years ago, which often leads to days of mental exhaustion—a situation I’m not happy about. I need to become more comfortable **focusing on the essential knowledge required to build the company, while maintaining a sense of curiosity without the pressure to master everything**. It’s simply not feasible.

At the same time, [Tuist](https://tuist.io) has the potential to make a significant impact in the Swift ecosystem, particularly in developer tools and packages. With more focus, we could capitalize on that opportunity. For example, I want to create a design system for the CLI, which would elevate the Tuist user experience and lay the groundwork for other CLIs. Or I could dive into Swift’s concurrency updates and develop a resource that benefits both us and the broader community. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to pursue these goals because I’ve been preoccupied with learning other technologies. It’s time for a change.

Moving forward, I’ll concentrate on three areas: building the company, Elixir, and Swift. Going deep in these areas will enable me to make meaningful contributions to Tuist.
