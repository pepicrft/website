Brains are complex. I don’t understand mine. I sometimes try to understand what it happens in it, and I can’t. It’s reaches limits, and that’s ok, so I’m trying to be nice with it.

Trying to find reasons why it sometimes feel exhausted is pointless. When it happens, I take breaks. Specially now, where as part of building [Tuist](https://tuist.io), I feel I’m constantly switching between different areas of the brain.

When I’m responding emails, it puts my brain in a mode that’s not inspired to code. When I’m coding, it’s not inspired to be social. And if I force it, it’s not natural so I exhaust it and reach frustration. *Tricky, isn’t it?*

Impostor syndrome invades me a lot too. I boycot myself. *What if Tuist doesn’t work? What if we don’t reach the point of financial sustainability that we are aspiring to have? What if we disappoint the organizations that are betting on us? What if I don’t have the mental clarity to pull this off?*

And social networks don't help here. I'd isolate myself from the world and focus on the craft, which brings me a lot of joy, but *how would people know about Tuist?* But if I spend too much time in it, envy and comparison start to creep in. *Are we doing enough? Should we do more?*

I don't have answers. But I know what makes my brain feel good, so I'm giving it what it needs. I enjoy creating things. I enjoy writing. I enjoy going for long walks. I enjoy sleeping a good siesta. So I'm prioritizing those things throughout my day, because otherwise, I'm not good to anyone.

Brains are complex, treat yours well. I didn't listen to mine for a long time, and it's time to change that.
