We started using [Incident.io](https://incident.io) on [Tuist](https://tuist.io) for incident management. The tool is great, but we were missing a way to connect it with our monitoring system, [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com). When you look at the integrations available, App Signal isn't there.

Luckily AppSignal supports sending [webhooks when anomalies are detected](https://docs.appsignal.com/application/integrations/webhooks.html#anomaly-detection), but the schema of the payload and the headers didn't match what Incident.io expected. For example, Incident.io expects the requests to come with an `Authorization: Bearer xxx` header.

To make the integration work, we decided to use [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). We created a worker that transforms the payload sent by AppSignal into the one that Incident.io expects, and adds the `Authorization` header. The worker is deployed to Cloudflare, and we configured AppSignal to send the webhooks to the worker's URL. Below is the code of the worker:

```
const token = "...."
export default {
 async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
 const alert = await request.json()
 const { alert_id, metric_name, human_comparison_value, trigger_description } = alert;
 // https://docs.appsignal.com/application/integrations/webhooks.html#exception-incidents

 await fetch("https://api.incident.io/v2/alert_events/http/....", { headers: {
 "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`,
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }, method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({
 "title": `${metric_name} peaked above ${human_comparison_value}`,
 "description": trigger_description,
 "deduplication_key": `${alert_id}`,
 "status": "firing",
 "metadata": {
 ...alert
 }
 })})
 return new Response(JSON.stringify({status: "success"}), {status: 200, headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"}});
 },
};
```

Hopefully, Incident.io will provide an integration with AppSignal in the future, but until then, this solution works well for us.
