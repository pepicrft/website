As we continue to work on turning Tuist into a long-term sustainable business, I've been learning a lot about **the importance of patience and perseverance.**

This is something that I used to have years ago, but that I lost when I was embedded in a working culture of *making great decisions fast* with tight deadlines and a very competitive environment. When something spans several days, weeks, or months, I feel like I'm not making progress. Part of me thinks that those are steps in the right direction, but the other part of me feels like I'm not moving fast enough. And because we are limited in resources, I wonder if we are making the right decisions. Suddenly I'm flooded with doubts and fears.

When I look around, I see companies in a similar space that are moving fast, raising money, and hiring people, part of me feels like we are falling behind. However, if I look closely, all I see are attempts to run sprints one after the other, fear of being open and transparent about their business, obsession with growth at all costs, complex pricing models to squeeze as much money as possible from customers...

We are [running a marathon](__GHOST_URL__/blog/2024/07/04/its-a-marathon), and that takes time. And I need to get comfortable with that regaining the patience and perseverance that I once had.

And when I calm down, I notice I can show the best version of myself. I'm inspired to help, to bet on unique ideas, to be open and transparent, and to build a company that I'm proud of. It'll just take a bit of emotional work to get there. But I'm confident that we'll get there.
