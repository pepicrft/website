I migrated this blog to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). I did it to consolidate everything I had learned about the framework, and be able to SSR static pages with dynamic content. For example, I'll be able to collect data from external sources like GitHub and include it in the [about](__GHOST_URL__/about) page.

I ported over the same boring design I had in the previous [Jekyll-based](https://jekyllrb.com/) website. I love it because it reminds us the origins of the web as a tool to share documents. The focus is in the content and not that much on the continent.

Expect some follow-up blog posts from me talking about the things that I like and don't like about Svelte and SvelteKit, and how it compares to other frameworks like Vue and React.
